### Introduction

I used the HW 6 example for the mosquito weight for the Aedes aegypti species. I chose to upload the vector of mosquito weights onto python, assigning the objects as "females" and "males" accordingly. I also calculated the mean of these weights through python. Next, I reticulated this vector into R. I then had to converted the python objects into numeric R objects since I believe the original object were being interpreted as factors. Next, I created the same random distribution as seen in the homework and then I calculated the mean difference as my test statistic. The p-value was shown to be significant at a value of 0.0034. I then incorporate a plot visualizing the null distribution and the test statistic. The majority of the distribution is within the test statistic range.

```{R}
library(reticulate)
``` 

```{python}
females = [0.291, 0.208, 0.241, 0.437, 0.228, 0.256, 0.208, 0.234, 0.320, 0.340, 0.150]
males = [0.185, 0.222, 0.149, 0.187, 0.191, 0.219, 0.132, 0.144, 0.140]
sum(females)/len(females)
sum(males)/len(males)
``` 

```{R}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
Female <- as.numeric(py$females)
Male <- as.numeric(py$males)

set.seed(348)

dat <- data.frame(sex = c(rep("Female", 11), rep("Male", 9)), weight = c(Female, Male))
head(dat)

random <- vector()
for (i in 1:5000) {
  rand.dat <- data.frame(weight = sample(dat$weight), sex = dat$sex)
  random[i] <- mean(rand.dat[rand.dat$sex == "Male", ]$weight) - mean(rand.dat[rand.dat$sex == "Female", ]$weight)
}

dat %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarize(means = mean(weight)) %>% 
  summarize("mean.diff" = diff(means))

mean(random > 0.09048485 | random < -0.09048485)

data.frame(random) %>%ggplot(aes(random)) + geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..)) + geom_density() + geom_vline(xintercept = 0.09048485) + geom_vline(xintercept = -0.09048485)
```
